# Manual Test Cases for HIPAA-Compliant Messaging System

---

## Acceptance Criteria 1: Only authenticated users can send/receive messages within the system.

### Test Case 1.1: Successful Message Transmission (Happy Path - Authenticated User)
*   **Test Case ID:** TC_HIPAA_MSG_001
*   **Title:** Send and receive a secure message between two authenticated users.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   User A (Authenticated) is logged in.
    *   User B (Authenticated) is logged in.
    *   Both users have active, valid sessions.
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  User A composes a new message to User B.
    2.  User A enters randomized sample message content (e.g., "Hello User B, this is a secure message. Testing special characters !@#$%^&*()_+ and emojis üòÇüëç").
    3.  User A sends the message.
    4.  User B logs in (if not already) and navigates to their inbox.
    5.  User B opens the message from User A.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User A Credentials: `authenticated_user_A@example.com`, `SecurePassword1!`
    *   User B Credentials: `authenticated_user_B@example.com`, `SecurePassword2!`
    *   Message Content: Randomized sample text including alphanumeric, special characters, and emojis.
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   User A's message is successfully sent.
    *   User B receives the message in their inbox.
    *   The message content is displayed accurately and completely for User B.
    *   No error messages or warnings are displayed during transmission or receipt.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Tags:** security, authentication, happy path, message transmission

### Test Case 1.2: Message Transmission - Unauthenticated User Access (Negative Path)
*   **Test Case ID:** TC_HIPAA_MSG_002
*   **Title:** Attempt to send a message as an unauthenticated user.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   User is not logged in (guest user).
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Attempt to access the messaging system's "Compose Message" feature directly via URL or UI if accessible.
    2.  If a compose message interface is loaded, attempt to enter message content and send it.
*   **Test Data:** N/A (unauthenticated state)
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   The user is redirected to the login page immediately upon attempting to access messaging features.
    *   If a compose message UI is somehow loaded, the "Send" button is disabled or an error message prevents sending due to lack of authentication.
    *   No message is sent or received.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Tags:** security, authentication, negative path, access control

### Test Case 1.3: Message Transmission - Invalid Session (Negative Path)
*   **Test Case ID:** TC_HIPAA_MSG_003
*   **Title:** Attempt to send a message with an invalid or expired session.
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   User is logged in.
    *   User session has expired or been invalidated (e.g., administrator forced logout, session timeout).
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  User logs in and navigates to the messaging system.
    2.  Invalidate the user's session (simulate session expiry by waiting for idle timeout or via admin action).
    3.  User attempts to compose and send a message.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User Credentials: `test_user@example.com`, `Password123!`
    *   Session Invalidation: Simulate a 5-minute idle timeout or immediate admin logout.
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   The system detects the invalid session.
    *   The user is immediately redirected to the login page or prompted to re-authenticate.
    *   The message sending attempt fails with an appropriate error message (e.g., "Session expired. Please log in again.").
    *   No message is sent or received.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Tags:** security, session management, negative path, authentication

## Acceptance Criteria 2: Messages must be encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Test Case 2.1: In-transit Encryption Verification (Happy Path)

    *   Network monitoring tools (e.g., Wireshark) are available.
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Start network traffic capture.
    2.  Authenticated User A sends a message to User B (e.g., "This message should be encrypted during transit.").
    3.  Stop network traffic capture.
    4.  Analyze the captured network packets.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User A Credentials: `user_a_encrypt@example.com`, `EncryptPass!`
    *   Message Content: "This message contains sensitive info: Patient ID 12345."
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   All message payloads in the captured traffic are unreadable/encrypted (garbled text) and transmitted over HTTPS (port 443).
    *   No plaintext message content is visible in the network trace.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Tags:** security, encryption, data privacy, network, happy path

### Test Case 2.2: At-rest Encryption Verification (Happy Path)
*   **Test Case ID:** TC_HIPAA_MSG_005
*   **Title:** Verify messages are encrypted when stored (at rest).
*   **Preconditions:**
    *   Database/storage access with appropriate tools (e.g., database client, file system access).
*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Authenticated User A sends a message to User B.
    2.  Access the backend database or storage where messages are persisted.
    3.  Locate the stored message content.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User A Credentials: `user_a_atrest@example.com`, `AtRestPass!`
    *   Message Content: "Patient Name: Jane Doe, Diagnosis: Flu." (Sample PHI)
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   The stored message content in the database/storage is unreadable/encrypted (hashed or gibberish).
    *   No plaintext message content (especially PHI) is visible in the database records or storage files.
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Tags:** security, encryption, data privacy, database, happy path

*   **Test Steps:**
    1.  Authenticated User A sends a message to User B containing sample PHI.
    2.  Access the server logs (e.g., application logs, web server logs).
    3.  Search for the sent message content and PHI within the logs.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User A Credentials: `logger_test@example.com`, `LogTest123`
    *   Message Content: "This message contains PHI: Patient Name: John Smith, DOB: 01/01/1980, Medication: Aspirin, Diagnosis: Hypertension." (Randomized sample PHI)
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   The actual PHI (Patient Name, DOB, Medication, Diagnosis) is not present in plaintext in any server logs.
    *   PHI should be redacted, masked, or replaced with placeholders (e.g., `[PHI]`, `***`) in the logs.
*   **Priority:** Critical
*   **Tags:** security, data privacy, logging, PHI, negative path, audit

### Test Case 3.2: PHI Redaction in Browser Cache/Local Storage (Negative Path)

    2.  Open browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools).
    3.  Navigate to "Application" tab (for Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, Cache Storage) and "Network" tab (for cached responses).
    4.  Search for the sent/received message content and PHI within these storage areas.
*   **Test Data:**
    *   User A Credentials: `browser_cache_test@example.com`, `CacheCheck!`
    *   Message Content: "PHI Data: Patient ID: 98765, Treatment: Chemotherapy, Doctor: Dr. House." (Randomized sample PHI)
*   **Expected Results:**
    *   No plaintext PHI or sensitive message content is found in the browser's cache, local storage, session storage, or indexed databases.
    *   Sensitive data, if cached, should be encrypted or tokenized.
*   **Priority:** Critical
*   **Tags:** security, data privacy, browser cache, PHI, negative path

    2.  As another authenticated user, attempt to view the message (if it was a message involving them).
    3.  As an administrator, attempt to retrieve the *content* of the deleted message through any backdoor or administrative interface (should only see metadata, not content).
*   **Test Data:**
    *   Deleted Message ID.
    *   User A Credentials (who deleted the message).
    *   User B Credentials (if applicable).
    *   Admin Credentials.
